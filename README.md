# Chat Room ðŸ’¬
- A simple real-time chat app built using Node, Socket.IO, jQuery, and vanilla JavaScript
- Users can send messages in real time, private message others, and manage interactions by banning or disabling users

## Collaboration 
This project was a collaborative effort; I worked alongside @jazz-y.

- I mainly programmed the front end, while jazz-y programmed the back end

## Getting Started
`cd` to the working directory. Then install the `socket.io` module: 
```bash
npm install socket.io
```
Start the application:
```bash
node chatserver.js
```
Server will be running on port 3456. 
http://localhost:3456/
